The goal of wcep is to analyze time-to-event data with multiple events, for instance death and shock with related severity weights. The weight of death is always 1 and other events have a positive weight smaller than 1.

This package provides two main functions: wcep produce survival probabilities with related variances, and plot function uses survival probabilities to illustrate Kaplan Meier curve with prespecified confidence interval. Also, it provides a dataset.

## Installation
